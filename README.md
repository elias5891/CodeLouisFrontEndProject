This is a multi-page setup/launcher/informational page(s) for the KTaNE League competitions.  KTaNE, or Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, is a computer game in which one player uses the computer, and gets a digital bomb with various 'modules' to disable to keep the bomb from detonating.  The other players get a copy of a manual that covers instructions on how to solve each of the module types.  The focus of the game is on proper communication between the defuser of the bomb, and the experts with the manual.

Included on this webpage is information about the league, videos of past competitions, contact information, and practice problems for one of the simplier modules.  This can also be reached by going to www.elias5891.com

This project is the final "Front End Web Development" project for the Code Louisville May 2018 course.
