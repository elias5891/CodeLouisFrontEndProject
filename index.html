				The KTaNE League is a competitive setting for Steel Crate Game's "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes", where various players/teams compete across a number of weeks, playing identical bombs to compete for the best score.  After a number of weeks, the top performers move on to a elimination style bracket, where players are eliminated until only the top team for the season remains.
