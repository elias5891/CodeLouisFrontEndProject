			Need to reach out about the league?  There are a few ways to get in touch with us.<br>
			<br>
			<br>First, you can find us on <a href="https://discord.gg/r8YPGs4">Discord</a>.  This is the best way to contact me/us, as notifications are usually received quickly.
			<br><br><br>Second, you can email us at <a href="mailto:league@elias5891.com">this email address</a>.  This is a bit slower than Discord, but is another way to reach out if you do not presently have a Discord account.		
			<br><br><br>Finally, you can fill out the contact form below.  Do note that this is the slowest method, and thus may not be answered in a timely fashion.
